# Vehicle Unit â€“ FPV Tele-Driving Trainer

## ðŸ“– Overview
The Vehicle Unit is the **RC car platform** for the FPV Tele-Driving Trainer project.  
It consists of a Raspberry Pi handling **motor control** and **live FPV video streaming** to the Control Unit's VR headset.

## ðŸ›  Components
- **Raspberry Pi 4/5** (for processing and streaming)
- **Motors & Steering**:
  - DC motor(s) for driving
  - Servo motor for steering
- **Motor Driver**: L298N / L293D / ESC
- **FPV Camera**: Pi Camera Module / USB camera
- **Wireless Communication**: Built-in Pi Wi-Fi or external dongle
- **Power Supply**: LiPo battery

---

## ðŸ“¡ How It Works
1. Raspberry Pi receives control commands from the Control Unit over Wi-Fi or RF.
2. Pi translates commands into PWM signals for motors and steering.
3. Pi captures video from the camera.
4. Video is streamed in **side-by-side (SBS)** format for VR headset compatibility.
5. Video feed is viewed in real-time by the driver through a VR headset.

## ðŸ“· Video Streaming
- **Protocol Options**:
  - WebRTC (low latency, <100 ms)
  - GStreamer (configurable latency)
  - Dedicated FPV transmitter/receiver for near-zero delay
- **Format**: Side-by-side (SBS) for VR headset display.
