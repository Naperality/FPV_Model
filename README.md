# FPV Tele-Driving Trainer

## 📖 Overview

The **FPV Tele-Driving Trainer** is a personal engineering project that simulates the experience of driving a real vehicle through a **first-person view (FPV)** system.  
It combines **hardware controls** such as a steering wheel, pedals, and gearshift with a live video feed from a camera mounted on a small RC car.  
The project aims to create a realistic tele-driving experience while also serving as a training platform for driving simulation, robotics, and remote control applications.

- Design and fabricate custom **physical driving controls**:
  - Steering wheel
  - Accelerator pedal
  - Brake pedal
  - Clutch pedal
  - Gear stick
  - Handbrake
- Enable smooth real-time driving via **low-latency video streaming**
- Practice integration of **hardware electronics**, **software control systems**, and **mechanical design**
- Explore applications in **teleoperation, robotics education, and simulation training**

## 🛠️ System Components

### 1. **Vehicle Platform**
- Small RC chassis or custom-built frame
- **DC motors / Servo motors** for movement and steering
- Motor driver module for control signals
- Mounted FPV camera for live streaming

### 2. **Control Hardware**
- DIY steering wheel mechanism
- Pedals (gas, brake, clutch) with potentiometer or load cell input
- Gear shifter with positional sensors
- Handbrake lever
- Microcontroller (e.g., **Arduino Mega/Uno** or **ESP32**) for reading control inputs

### 3. **Processing & Communication**
- **Raspberry Pi** (onboard vehicle) for camera feed and command processing
- Wi-Fi or RF module for control signal transmission
- Low-latency video streaming protocol (e.g., WebRTC, MJPEG stream)

## 📡 How It Works

1. **Driver’s Station**  
   The user operates physical controls (steering wheel, pedals, gearstick, handbrake) built from custom parts connected to a microcontroller.

2. **Signal Processing**  
   Control inputs are read by the microcontroller and sent wirelessly to the Raspberry Pi on the vehicle.

3. **Vehicle Response**  
   The Raspberry Pi translates received commands into motor and servo actions, while continuously streaming live video from the onboard camera.

4. **First-Person Driving**  
   The user views the video feed in real-time, creating the illusion of being inside the vehicle.
